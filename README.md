**Objective**: To estimate the impact of adhering to dental quality measures on patient oral health outcomes. 

**Design, setting and participants**: Using a target trial emulation, a causal inference framework, this retrospective study estimated the difference in the risk of developing tooth decay between US children who adhered (treated) to process-based dental quality measures (receiving topical fluoride and sealant) and those who did not (control). Electronic health records of US children/adolescents aged 0-18 years from 2014 to 2020 were used. To emulate random treatment assignment based on baseline confounders, coarsened exact matching was used to produce covariate balance between treated and control groups. A time-to-event regression model produced effect estimates, adjusting for time-varying covariates. Near/far matching was used to account for unmeasured confounders as a sensitivity analysis. Data were analyzed from May 1 to August 7, 2023.

**Exposures**: Adherence to dental quality measures

**Main outcomes and Measures**: Incidence of tooth decay

**Results**: Among 69,212 US children aged between 0 and 18 [mean (SD) age, 10.2(5.0)], 1930 Asian (2.8%), 2038 Black (2.9%), 8667 Hispanic (12.5%), 33632 White (48.6%), and Other/Multiracial/Unidentified 22945 (33.2%) were identified. Relative to control individuals, treated individuals were more likely to be at elevated-risk of caries (fluoride:76.5%vs. 39.8%; sealant:54.6%vs. 44.0%) and have regular dental visits (fluoride:100.0%vs. 35.9%; sealant:39.2%vs. 38.4%). Adherence to quality measures was associated with reduced risk of tooth decay with HRs of 0.82 (95%CI:0.78,0.86) for fluoride and 0.86 (95%CI:0.76,0.97) for sealant in the matched cohort. Benefits of adhering to quality measures were greater among elevated-risk and publicly insured children relative to low-risk and commercially insured children for both measures. 

**Conclusions**: In this cohort study, adhering to dental quality measures was associated with reduced risk of tooth decay, and benefits were greater among elevated-risk and publicly insured children. These findings provide insights in facilitating targeted application of quality measures or developing more tailored quality improvement initiatives.
